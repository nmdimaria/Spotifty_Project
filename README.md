# Spotify_Project

Was thinking of taking in data from Spotify's APIs combined with some external data sets to predict which songs will be popular in the future. Spotify's machine learning algorithm analyzes music to determine parameters like key, tempo, time signature, and even danceability and liveliness. 

Have some of the API calls already done out. Check them out and see what you think!
