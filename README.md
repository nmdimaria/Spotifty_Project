# Spotify_Project

Have you ever thought that "All pop music sounds the same"? Our final project will finally test that hypothesis...

We will be using data from Spotify's APIs combined with some external data sets to predict which songs will be popular in the future. Spotify's machine learning algorithm analyzes music to determine parameters like key, tempo, time signature, and even danceability, liveliness and popularity. This data, combined with some external data sources cataloguing popular music over the past 10 years and a selection of machine learning models (namely Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Support Vectors) will help us prove/disprove our hypothesis and finally put to rest that pop songs have similar, measureable characteristics.

Part of our presentation/visualizations will be to pick out common elements and describe them in comparison to songs that do not perform as well.

Our group has a deep passion for music and we are very excited to present our findings.
