# Spotify_Project

### Deliverable 2: 

- Presentiation can be found at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l4uSM41oqsHwszULNW9IYb_7RSEgzeA58z1-NmlePnE/edit#slide=id.p
- Our Github is up to date with all relevent content ("Final Code" folder contains ETL)
- SVM file is our machine learning model
- Database SQL schema can be found in "Final Code" folder and in DB Schema

## Summary
Have you ever thought that "All pop music sounds the same"? Our final project will finally test that hypothesis...

We will be using data from Spotify's APIs combined with some external data sets to predict which songs will be popular in the future. Spotify's machine learning algorithm analyzes music to determine parameters like key, tempo, time signature, and even danceability, liveliness and popularity. This data, combined with some external data sources cataloguing popular music over the past 10 years and support vector machine learning algorithms will help us prove/disprove our hypothesis and finally put to rest that pop songs have similar, measureable characteristics and that we may even be able to predict future popularity.

Part of our presentation/visualizations will be to pick out common elements and describe them in comparison to songs that do not perform as well. Our group has a deep passion for music and we are very excited to present our findings.

## Technologies Employed

- Spotipy Python/API library
- Python with Pandas/Numpy etc. for ETL
- SVM, Random Forrest machine learning models
- Postgres database
- Tableau for visualizations

## Communication
We will be using our Slack group as well as regular Zoom meetings to coordinate as well as keeping our code on Github for collaberation
